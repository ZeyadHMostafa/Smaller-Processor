# Smaller-Processor
 A simplified design for a microprocessor based on Morris Manoâ€™s simple processor, including a logic gate simulation, a unique assembly language and its assembler, and an emulator for the processor packed in an application with the assembler.

 ## How to use
 to run the application just run `code/dist/app.exe`

 OR

 run app.py from the `code` directory

## Documentation

- the explanation for different codes  and code snippets is included in the excel sheets
- the main purpose and design purpose is explained in the word document

## Code files
### app
includes the GUI to use the other two scripts in an interactive manner
### assembler
allows the assembly of the specialized assembly code into machine readable code
### emulator
simulates the registers and memory of the device and allows running codes on it
### code.asm
This is an example code, it is not written in any traditional assembly language and iinstead uses the special made language for the model

## Simulation
There is a simulation that gives more insight into the inner workings of each part but it uses an obscure program and format and as such isn't provided
